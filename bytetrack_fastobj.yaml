# Customized bytetrack tracker config for fast moving object
# assuming object confidence is low, set at 0.05, like a tennis ball detection

# explain: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/4473#issuecomment-1686326137

tracker_type: bytetrack # tracker type, ['botsort', 'bytetrack']
track_high_thresh: 0.1 # threshold for the first association # original 0.5
track_low_thresh: 0.05 # threshold for the second association

# This is the threshold used for starting a new track. If a detection doesn't match any existing tracks and its score is above this threshold, a new track will be initialized.
new_track_thresh: 0.6 # threshold for init new track if the detection does not match any tracks # original 0.6

# in frames, so 30 fps, track_buffer==30, it will keep track for 1 second
track_buffer: 90 # buffer to calculate the time when to remove tracks original 30
# feature matching threshold
match_thresh: 0.9 # threshold for matching tracks # original 0.8

fuse_score: False # Whether to fuse confidence scores with the iou distances before matching original True
